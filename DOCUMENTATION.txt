NLP is a field of AI that enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. 
It powers applications like chatbots, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text summarization.
The core motive of NLP is to enable computers to understand, analyze, and generate human language in a meaningful way.

* Git only tracks files, not empty directories.
* If workflows/ is empty, it wonâ€™t be included in the repository.
* Adding a .gitkeep file forces Git to track the directory.
* The workflows/ directory is where GitHub Actions workflows (CI/CD automation) are stored.

-> src contains the components(local package),logging,exceptio,utils,config,pipeline,entity,constants

-> A .yaml (or .yml) file is a YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) file, commonly used for configuration in software development. It is human-readable and follows a key-value format, making it easier to understand than JSON or XML.
